        <h1>1. About Us</h1>
        <h5>At Encore, we believe that fashion should be as kind to the planet as it is to the people who wear it. Founded with the mission to revolutionize the way we approach style, we create high-quality, eco-friendly clothing that not only looks good but feels good too — for you and for the Earth.

            Our name, Encore, represents our commitment to sustainability and the idea of giving new life to fashion. Just as an encore performance brings something beautiful back to the stage, we strive to bring a sustainable approach back to the forefront of the fashion industry. Every piece we design, from our timeless wardrobe staples to our seasonal collections, is crafted with the environment in mind.</h5>

        <h1>2. Our Values</h1>
        <h3>Sustainability at the Core</h3>
        <h5>We believe in fashion that’s built to last, not just in terms of quality, but in how it impacts the planet. From using eco-friendly materials like organic cotton, recycled fibers, and plant-based dyes, to reducing waste in every step of the production process, we’re committed to making clothes that are as gentle on the Earth as they are on your skin.</h5>
        <h3>Transparency</h3>
        <h5>We know that to truly make a difference, we need to be open about how we do business. At Encore, we’re committed to complete transparency in our sourcing, manufacturing, and environmental impact. We collaborate with ethical suppliers and partners who share our vision for a cleaner, greener world.</h5>
        <h3>Timeless Style</h3>
        <h5>We design clothing that transcends trends and is made to last in both quality and style. Our pieces are meant to be worn season after season, mixing and matching effortlessly for a wardrobe that always feels fresh but never disposable. Fashion should be about longevity, not fast trends.</h5>
        <h3>Empowering Communities</h3>
        <h5>We believe that fashion can be a force for good, not just in terms of environmental impact, but in how it uplifts the communities it touches. That’s why we work closely with artisans, small manufacturers, and eco-conscious innovators to help build a more sustainable and equitable future for everyone involved in our process.</h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>3. Our Promises</h1>
        <h5>When you wear Encore, you’re not just choosing great fashion — you’re supporting a brand that’s helping to shape a better, more sustainable world. Our promise is simple: high-quality, eco-friendly fashion that doesn't compromise on style or the planet. Together, we can make every outfit an encore for the Earth.
